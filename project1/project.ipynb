You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Specifically, in this project you should: \n",
    "> 1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "> 2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. \n",
    "> 3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. \n",
    "> 4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.\""

    "1. **Time taken to complete the workout:** This represents a continuous variable, indicative of the duration participants spend engaging in the workout regimen.\n",
    "2. **Number of repetitions:** This discrete variable highlights the count of repetitions completed during the workout, showcasing an individual's performance.\n",
    "3. **Heart rate:** This continuous variable measures the physiological response, particularly the heart rate, during the workout session, offering insights into the intensity and exertion level.\n",
    "4. **Subjective difficulty level:** An ordinal variable expressing the perceived difficulty or intensity level experienced by participants during the workout.\n",

    "The analysis involves sourcing data from credible sources to establish feasible ranges for these variables. To factor in the time variable effectively, consideration will be given to specific workout modalities, such as CrossFit hero workouts, to reflect real-world scenarios. Anticipated heart rates during these workouts are projected to fall within the range of 120-200 beats per minute, aligning with the envisioned workout types.\n",
