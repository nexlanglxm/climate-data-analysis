You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Specifically, in this project you should: \n",
    "> 1. Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.\n",
    "> 2. Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other. \n",
    "> 3. Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible. \n",
    "> 4. Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.\""

    "- Blood lactic acid concentration:\n",
    "    - This is a continuous variable that measures the amount of lactic acid present in the blood during a high-intensity workout. \n",
    "    - Lactic acid is produced when the body breaks down carbohydrates for energy, and its concentration in the blood can indicate the intensity of the workout. Higher blood lactic acid concentrations indicate a more intense workout.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- Heart Rate:\n",
    "    - A continuous variable measuring participants' physiological response during workouts, offering insights into the intensity and exertion level. Potential heart rate ranges specific to different workout intensities and modalities can inform the simulation.\n",
    "    - Intensity Measurement: Heart rate indicates the physiological response to exercise, directly correlating with workout intensity. Monitoring heart rate provides insights into the exertion levels and the metabolic demand during workouts.\n",
    "    - Understanding heart rate ranges helps define safe and effective training zones, enabling trainers to tailor workouts based on desired intensity levels and physiological adaptations.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- Subjective Difficulty Level:\n",
    "    - Perceived Exertion: reflect an individual's perception of the workout's intensity, offering qualitative insights alongside quantitative metrics.[cite] \n",
    "    - Adaptation and personalization: understanding this assists in adjusting workouts to match individual capabilities, enhancing adherance amd motivation while preventing overexertion and underutilization, both psychological and physiological.\n",
    "---\n",
    "- Caloric Expenditure:\n",
    "- Caloric expenditure can be estimated using various methods, such as measuring the amount of oxygen consumed or the amount of heat produced by the body. The range of caloric expenditure for a high-intensity workout can vary depending on factors such as the individual's weight, fitness level, and the specific exercise being performed."
