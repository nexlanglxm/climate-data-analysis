# Functional Fitness Data Modeling using Python

This repository contains code and a Jupyter notebook focusing on modeling a synthetic dataset representing high-intensity fitness program performance using Python.

## Project Overview

This project aims to simulate a dataset that mirrors real-world phenomena related to high-intensity workout programs. It explores four key variables:

1. Time taken to complete the workout
2. Number of repetitions
3. Heart rate during the workout
4. Subjective difficulty level experienced during the workout

The Jupyter notebook (`project.ipynb`) included in this repository details the process of researching, simulating, analyzing, and interpreting this synthetic dataset.

## File Structure

- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the detailed process of dataset simulation, variable investigation, analysis, and interpretation.
- `readme.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, its objectives, and the tools used.

## Project Structure

The `project.ipynb` file within this repository is organized into the following sections:

- Introduction
