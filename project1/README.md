# Functional Fitness Data Modeling using Python

This repository contains code and a Jupyter notebook focusing on modeling a synthetic dataset representing high-intensity fitness program performance using Python.

## Project Overview

This project aims to simulate a dataset that mirrors real-world phenomena related to high-intensity workout programs. It explores four key variables:

1. Blood lactate concentration
2. Heart rate during the workout
3. Subjective difficulty level experienced during the workout
4. Caloric expenditure

The Jupyter notebook (`project.ipynb`) included in this repository details the process of researching, simulating, analysing, and interpreting this synthetic dataset.

## File Structure

- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the detailed process of dataset simulation, variable investigation, analysis, and interpretation.
- `readme.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, its objectives, and the tools used.

## Project Structure

The `project.ipynb` file within this repository is organized into the following sections:

- Introduction
- Dataset Overview
- Simulation Design
- Implementation of Simulation
- Analysis and Insights
- Conclusion

## Tools and Libraries

This project was developed using:

- Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter Notebooks (via Anaconda)
- Python 3.11.5
- Libraries used:
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
