# Project Idea: Simulating CrossFit workout performance

## Phenomenon

CrossFit workout performance; which can be measured in terms of various variables like time taken to complete a workout, number of repetitions completed in a given exercise, heart rate, and perceived workout difficulty.

## Variables

- Time taken to complete workout (continuous variable)
- Number of repetitions
- Heart rate
- Subjective difficulty level (ordinal variable)

## Likely Distributions

- Time taken to complete workout might follow a normal distribution
- The number of repetitions..
- Heart rate..
- Difficulty level should be represented as categorical data

## Relationships

- Time taken and the number of repetitions completed should be negatively correlated, as time decreases, repetitions should increase.
- Heart rate might have a positive correlation with number of repetitions completed, high intensity workouts can lead to higher heart rates.
- Difficulty level vs time taken & heart rate; harder workouts may lead to longer times and higher heart rates.

## Simulation Steps

1. Generate synthetic data for each variable using the appropriate numpy.random distributions

## Results
