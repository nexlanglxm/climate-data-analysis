# Project Idea: Simulating CrossFit workout performance

## Phenomenon

CrossFit workout performance; which can be measured in terms of various variables like time taken to complete a workout, number of repetitions completed in a given exercise, heart rate, and perceived workout difficulty

## Variables

- Time taken to complete workout  
- Number of repetitions
- Heart rate
- Subjective difficulty level

## Likely Distributions

- Time taken to complete workout might follow a 
- The number of repetitions..
- Heart rate..
- Difficulty level..
