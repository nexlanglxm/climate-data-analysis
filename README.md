# Programming for Data Analysis

This repository contains all the code and relevant files for the Programming for Data Analysis module.

## Project 1

Project 1 is a data synthesis project involving various programming techniques to analyze and interpret data. The main programming language used is Python, and the project makes use of libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The project meticulously simulates these variables to uncover potential associations and implications within the functional fitness domain.

## Project 2

Project 2 focuses on analyzing climate data to understand the relationships between various variables such as rainfall, CO2 levels, temperature, and Antarctic ice volume discharge. The analysis involves exploring how these variables interact and potentially impact each other over time. The project also involves creating visualizations to help understand the data and identify trends and patterns. The data used in this project includes historical records of rainfall, CO2 levels, temperature, and Antarctic ice volume discharge. The data has been processed and analyzed to identify correlations, trends, and potential impacts on future climate patterns.
